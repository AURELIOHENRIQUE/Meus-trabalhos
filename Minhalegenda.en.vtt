00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
Python is a high-level language, that is, it has a high level of abstraction
commands closer to human language than machine language.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.000
here we have two examples

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.330
with the python code on the left, and the assembly code on the right

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:28.000
and we can see the difference between the syntax of the two, it is much easier to read the code in python
that we have no idea of ​​how python works than reading the code in assembly.
